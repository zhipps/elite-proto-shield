elite-proto-shield
==================
The elite prototype shield is the only Arduino shield that allows you to take an idea and put it on a breadboard, transfer it to a perforated board, and move your project's arduino code to an ATtiny microcontroller. Your project will now be available as a dedicated circuit board that you can take with you anywhere. No more buying expensive Arduino prototyping shields that you are afraid to use because they are a one time use product. The elite prototype shield comes with smaller prototype cartridges that are so inexpensive that you don't need to feel bad about using them up. When you need more cartridges just come back here to stock up!
